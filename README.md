# README

This is my clone of Facebook. I renamed it Fakebook. I'm going to be using this ReadMe as my record keeper. It will state what part of the process I am currently working on, problems I'm experiencing, as well as completed projects. The newest entries will be at the bottom. I hope to update these constantly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Phase I create a Repo
  - I created this ReadMe as well as this repo
- Phase II create your own design documents
  - Went to the wiki page and created the following pages:
    - MVP List
    - Database Schema
    - Routes
    - Sample State
    - Component Hierarchy
    - Wireframes
- I went on to create a Wireframe as well as a Component Hierarchy. All can be found in the wiki page!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Phase III Sample State
  - I created a sampleState outline in my wiki. I detailed what I think my data should look like before I pass it into my components in my soon-to-be-created frontend folder/files
- I also reorganized a few files and added a few things in.
  - Redo: MVP List because I found a recommended MVP list from the instructions and decided to schedule myself around that instead of my own
  - Updated my main folder for organizational purposes, placing all my prepwork into a folder labeld Prepwork.
  - Redo: Component Hierarchy & Wireframes to accommodate the MVP List
