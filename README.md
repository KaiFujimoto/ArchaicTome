# README

This is my clone of Facebook. I renamed it Fakebook. I'm going to be using this ReadMe as my record keeper. It will state what part of the process I am currently working on, problems I'm experiencing, as well as completed projects. The newest entries will be at the bottom. I hope to update these constantly.
